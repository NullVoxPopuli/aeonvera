# InstantReporting is used when a specially flagged request hits the application.
# The agent traces the request regardless of its performance characteristics, and reports it immediately to our servers, for instant feedback.
# The request is detected in the ActionController instrumentation, and flagged in TrackedRequest. The trace is prepped here, and handed off to a Reporter for the actual POST.
