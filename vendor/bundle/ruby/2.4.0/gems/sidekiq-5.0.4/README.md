Simple, efficient background processing for Ruby.

Sidekiq uses threads to handle many jobs at the same time in the
same process.  It does not require Rails but will integrate tightly with
Rails to make background processing dead simple.

Sidekiq is compatible with Resque.  It uses the exact same
message format as Resque so it can integrate into an existing Resque processing farm.
You can have Sidekiq and Resque run side-by-side at the same time and
use the Resque client to enqueue jobs in Redis to be processed by Sidekiq.

Performance

Sidekiq 4.0.0    | 10ms	| 151 MB  | 22 sec  | **4500 jobs/sec**
Sidekiq 3.5.1    | 22ms	| 1257 MB | 125 sec | 800 jobs/sec
Resque 1.25.2    |  -	  | -       | 420 sec | 240 jobs/sec
DelayedJob 4.1.1 |  -   | -       | 465 sec | 215 jobs/sec

Sidekiq stays fast by using the [JProfiler java profiler](http://www.ej-technologies.com/products/jprofiler/overview.html) to find and fix
performance problems on JRuby.  Unfortunately MRI does not have good multithreaded profiling tools.
